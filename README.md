# CTI-Dissertation-Notebooks
This repository contains Jupyter notebooks developed as part of the final year dissertation for a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science. The project focuses on the  simulation of an AI-powered cyber threat intelligence (CTI) platform, leveraging the CTU-13 dataset to detect and classify malicious network traffic using machine learning and deep learning techniques.

Key Objectives:
  Preprocess and analyze the CTU-13 dataset for traffic classification.

  Implement and evaluate machine learning models (Random Forest, Deep Learning) for threat detection.

  Visualize model performance and feature importance.

  Demonstrate the effectiveness of AI techniques in enhancing CTI capabilities.
